                <p>Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that is not normally serious but the symptoms can be very unpleasant. It is usually spread by having unprotected (condomless) sex. The condition affects both men and women, with symptoms usually appearing between five and 28 days after exposure to the infection. However, men rarely experience any symptoms when they are infected, and approximately 50% of women also experience no symptoms at all. If symptoms do appear, women may get soreness, inflammation and itching around the vagina, a fishy-smelling discharge that may be unusually thick, thin, frothy, yellow or green, pain or discomfort when passing urine, discomfort during sex and pain in the lower abdomen. Men can also experience pain after urination and ejaculation, thin white discharge from the penis and discomfort during sex.</p>

                <h2>How to Avoid</h2>

                <p>The good news is that trichomoniasis is relatively easy to avoid. Simply use condoms during all sexual contact and you'll be protected against this and all manner of other unwanted nasties.</p>

                <h2>Treatment</h2>

                <p>Trichomoniasis is usually treated quickly and easily with an antibiotic that, if taken correctly, is at least 95% effective. Your doctor or local GUM clinic will be able to advise further. Let's be honest, it's probably easier to just use a condom in the first place.</p>
