            <h1>More About My RiskChecker</h1>
            <p>The My RiskChecker app is designed to enable users to get a real sense of the health risks they may be taking through their sexual behaviour. It asks a brief series of questions before assigning the user an indicative risk level based on the answers given. The app is designed to be quick, simple and discreet to use, and is optimised for use on personal mobile devices like smartphones and tablets (as well as working on desktop computers and laptops). It contains advice on 10 of the most common STIs (Sexually Transmitted Infections), as well as enabling users to locate their nearest GUM clinic (sexual health clinic).</p>
